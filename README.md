# Instacart Basket Analysis

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using the Instacart dataset, which contains **32 million orders from over 4 million users**. By leveraging SQL-based relational modeling and itemset mining techniques, the study identifies frequently purchased product combinations and trends in shopping patterns.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on understanding Instacart users' shopping behavior through **data preprocessing, database modeling, and market basket analysis**. The dataset was acquired from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)** and structured into relational and document-based models to enable efficient querying and insight generation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing & Integration**: Standardized data to improve quality and consistency.  
- **Relational & NoSQL Modeling**: Implemented **SQL** for structured queries and **MongoDB** for document-based storage.  
- **Query Optimization**: Constructed advanced **SQL queries** for efficient retrieval and analysis.  
- **Itemset Mining & Market Basket Analysis**: Used **Apriori Algorithm** to discover frequently purchased product sets.  
- **Visualization & Insights**: Analyzed purchasing patterns to support recommendations and inventory optimization.  

## Technologies Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)**: Data integration, complex queries, and indexing.  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL modeling for flexible data storage.  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Faker)**: Data preprocessing and synthetic data generation.  
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Frequent itemset mining for association rule discovery.  

## Results and Insights

- **Frequent Item Combinations**: Identified products often purchased together to optimize recommendations.  
- **Shopping Trends**: Analyzed purchase frequency by time of day and day of the week.  
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries for improved retrieval speed and efficiency.  

This project provides actionable insights for **e-commerce platforms, retail analytics, and personalized marketing** by understanding customer purchasing behavior.
